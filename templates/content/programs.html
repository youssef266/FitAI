            <h2>Additional Tips</h2>
            <p>
                * Warm up with 5-10 minutes of cardio and dynamic stretching before each workout.<br>
                * Rest for 60-90 seconds between sets, and 120-180 seconds between exercises.<br>
                * Adjust the weight and reps based on your fitness level and goals.<br>
                * Increase the weight or reps every two weeks to continue progressive overload.<br>
                * Eat a caloric surplus of 250-500 calories above your maintenance level to support muscle growth.<br>
                * Get at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night to aid in recovery.
